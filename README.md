# Comicfy - AI-Driven Comic Creator ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤–

Comicfy is an innovative application that leverages generative AI techniques and NLP to transform small stories into visually engaging comic panels. By combining state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models and layout optimization tools, Comicfy delivers an end-to-end comic creation experience.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Story-to-Comic Conversion**: Generate multiple comic panels based on user-provided story chunks.
- **NLP-Powered Text Parsing**: Automatically break down user stories into meaningful segments using SpaCy.
- **Image Generation**: Create high-quality images with Diffusers and the Stable Diffusion model.
- **Speech Bubble Integration**: Add dialogue or captions to panels seamlessly.
- **Panel Layout Optimization**: Arrange panels for a fluid storytelling experience.

## ðŸ’» Installation and Usage
Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the project on your local system:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/comicfy.git
   cd comicfy
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but Recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and GPU CUDA support. Run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pretrained Models**:
   Place the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model files in the `backend/assets` directory. Update paths in `comic_generator.py` as needed.

5. **Run the Backend**:
   Start the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend**:
   Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser or host it locally.

7. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Input a small story into the frontend interface.
   - The NLP parser will segment the story.
   - The Comic Generator will create images based on the parsed chunks.
   - Speech bubbles and panels will be finalized for download.
